Play Bounce:
(run "python bounce.py" in the terminal)

Instructions:
After you hit play, the ball will far from the top of the screen.
Keep the ball from touching the ground by creating platforms for the ball to bounce off of.
To create a platform you must click any two point on the screen.
A line will be made between the two endpoints, creating the platform.
After every 5 points, another ball will appear for you to keep off the ground.
If any ball hit the ground, you lose.

Current bugs:
1. If a ball and your mouse have the same coordinates (if they touch), the program crashes.
2. When you try to create a vertical line a float division by zero error crashes the program
